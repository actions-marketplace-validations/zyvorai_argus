"""Frozen-binary-aware repo-root resolution.

Every module that needs to locate `templates/`, `prompts/`, `tests/`,
`reports/`, etc. relative to the repo root should call `repo_root()` here
instead of hand-rolling `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[N]` locally --
that pattern assumes a real filesystem checkout and silently resolves to
the wrong directory (or one that doesn't exist at all) inside a
PyInstaller-frozen binary, since a frozen build's `__file__` points into a
one-off temp extraction directory, not the source tree.

See ROADMAP.md's "Desktop app v2" section -- this is the code-side half of
what a real single-binary freeze needs; Playwright's browser binaries not
being freezable is the other, unrelated half.

        # plays the same role there). Either way, that IS "repo root" for a

        # etc. at that same top level, mirroring docker/Dockerfile's layout.
