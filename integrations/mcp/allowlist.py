"""Client-side allowlist of job kinds the MCP server will trigger.

Defense in depth on top of the server-side `jobs:write` RBAC scope (see
`orchestrator/security/rbac.py`): a leaked or overly broad service token
still shouldn't let an unvetted chat message reach the heavier/riskier job
kinds. Mirrors the pattern already used in `orchestrator/slack_gateway.py`'s
`SUPPORTED_KINDS`.

Excluded deliberately: `full` (heavy pipeline with its own PR/notify wiring —
leave to CI), `create`/`generate`/`import_codegen` (write test code),
`auth_test` (real login attempts against prod creds), `loadtest` (volumetric
— the server's SSRF allowlist doesn't defend against a chat user DoS-ing an
allowed target), and `flow`/`realtime`/`ai_flow`/`har_replay` (heavier/less
predictable — revisit once there's real usage data).
