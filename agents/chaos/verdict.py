"""Deterministic resilience-assessment rubric for `chaos_inject`/
`chaos_webhook` -- no LLM call, unlike exploit_poc's script-generation path.
There's no ambiguity to resolve here: "did the target degrade gracefully
under fault" reduces to three measurable signals (see ROADMAP.md's
chaos-testing section for the full design rationale):

1. No raw stack trace / unstructured error leaked to the client.
2. Error rate during the fault window stayed under an operator-set threshold.
3. Latency recovered to baseline within an operator-set SLA after the fault
   was removed.
