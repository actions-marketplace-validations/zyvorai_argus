"""Regression guard for a real data-loss bug found live 2026-09-08.

Playwright's HTML reporter unconditionally clears its entire `outputFolder`
before writing a report -- even when zero tests run (e.g. a bad `testDir`
filter). `playwright/playwright.config.ts` used to point that folder
directly at `reports/`, the same directory Mission Control's live SQLite
state (`reports/mission-control.db`), job/run history, and artifacts live
in. Any `smoke`/`flow` job -- including the control test a
`chaos_inject`/`chaos_webhook` run drives -- invokes this config, so every
such run silently destroyed the live database mid-process, crashing the
durable-jobs worker thread the next time it touched a now-missing table.

Reproduced directly: a throwaway Playwright project with `outputFolder`
pointed at a directory containing an unrelated file wiped that file even
when the test run itself failed with "No tests found"; pointing
`outputFolder` at a scoped subdirectory instead left it untouched.

This is a static check, not a real Playwright invocation (that needs a
network fetch + ~180MB of browser binaries neither CI nor this sandbox
should require for what is fundamentally a one-line config regression
guard) -- it parses the real config file's reporter list."""
